The main view is the primary workspace in PRBar. Open it by clicking the PRBar icon in the macOS menu bar.

## What you can do here

- Find pull requests quickly with search and scope filters
- Select a PR and inspect checks, workflow runs, and job states
- Open the PR or latest run directly in GitHub
- Copy the PR URL or branch name
- Pin the PR to the floating monitor window

## Layout overview

- Left panel: scope selector, search box, PR list
- Right panel: selected PR details, status summary, quick actions

## Quick workflow

1. Click the PRBar menu bar icon.
2. Choose a scope (`All`, `Personal`, or an org scope).
3. Use search to narrow the PR list.
4. Select a PR to inspect checks and workflow status.
5. Use `Pin Floating Monitor` when you want always-visible tracking.

## Tips

- Use search by repository name when your PR list is long.
- If data looks stale, trigger a manual refresh from the app controls.
- Keep the right panel focused on one PR while filtering on the left.
