# Monitor View Guide

![PRBar Monitor View](./monitor.png)

The monitor view is a floating window that keeps pinned PRs visible while you work in other apps.

## What you can do here

- Keep important PRs always on screen
- Track multiple pinned PRs at once
- Refresh all pinned PRs on demand
- Pause and resume auto-refresh
- Remove PR cards when they are no longer needed

## How to use it

1. Open the main view and select a PR.
2. Click `Pin Floating Monitor`.
3. Repeat for any additional PRs you want to track.
4. Use monitor controls (`Refresh now`, `Pause/Resume`) as needed.

## Best practices

- Pin only the PRs that require active attention.
- Keep auto-refresh enabled during review windows.
- Pause refresh temporarily if you are close to API rate limits.
- Remove completed PRs to keep the monitor focused.

## When monitor is most useful

- During code review sessions
- While waiting for CI/checks to turn green
- During release windows where status changes frequently
